# Deferred Shading 
**Note**: This is my university dissertation from ~2007. It's most certainly not a good example of how to program or even particularly relevant these days, but people keep coming to my website & downloading it, so here we are.

There's a separate README in the `executable` directory that contains the assets. If you want to build & run the code, you'll need to copy the assets from the `executable` directory into the `src` directory. The executable still runs on my machine (Windows 10 x64, NVIDIA 1060 Ti), but I've not built the code since I turned in the coursework in 2007.
